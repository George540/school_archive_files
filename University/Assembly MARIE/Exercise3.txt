/ Use marie.js.org, make sure ‘Output Mode’ is set to ‘DEC’.
/ For loop that sums index and variable until a condition has been met
/ Respective columns (left to right):
/ Label | Opcode or Directive | Operand or value |

/ Store our program starting from memory location x000. Not necessary to include this. Default is 000.
ORG 000

/ Load variable X and add index from every iteration
Loop,		Load 		X
			Add			Summer
            Store 		X
            
            / Load the summer and increment it by one for every iteration
            / This simulates the for loop incrementation
            Load		Summer
            Add			One
            Store 		Summer
            
            / Substract counter by 1, which is the actual loop incrementation
            Load		Count
            Subt		One
            Store		Count
            
            / This is the if statement, where it checks whether X is bigger than 120
            / To check this, we substract 120 from X to check whether it is positive or negative
			Load		X
            Subt		Cond
            
            / If the substraction is negative, it means X is smaller
            / So if X is not smaller than 120, the step jumps to the 'End" label
            SkipCond	000
            Jump		End
			
            / If the 'Count' reaches 0, it means loop is finished iterating
            / If not, the step iterates the loop once again
            / Note: The loop will never finish but it will break until the above condition is met
            Skipcond	400
            Jump		Loop
 
            / This was a testing case to check if the program runs correctly
            / By setting the End label here, we check the last result calculated for X,
            / which is 115. By simulating this in C language, X results indeed at 115

/ X variable initialized to 10
X,			DEC			10
/ Counter initialized to 100, which is the end of the loop at C language
Count,		DEC			100
/ Variable that is added at X and incremented at every loop
Summer,		DEC			0
/ Incrementation by 1
One,		DEC			1
/ Variable that is used to check whether X is bigger or smaller than 102 in its current state
Cond,		DEC 		102
